/* Minimal placeholder for npm run logs; in production, attach Winston to a log sink */
// This file prevents 'npm run logs' from failing in environments without a log aggregator.
// For containerized deploys, prefer: `docker logs -f <backend-container>`
// For PM2 deploys, prefer: `pm2 logs ecommerce-api`
console.log('Logs are emitted to stdout by Winston. Use your process manager or container logs to view them.');
